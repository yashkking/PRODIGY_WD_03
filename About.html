    What Is Coding?</h1>

    Coding creates a set of instructions for computers to follow. These instructions determine what actions a computer can and cannot take. Coding allows programmers to build programs, such as websites and apps. Computer programmers can also tell computers how to process data in better, faster ways.

    <h1>How Does Coding Work?</h1>
    To speak with computers, programmers learn different coding languages. Binary code is the primary language of all computers. Binary code consists of only two numbers: one and zero. In the binary coding language, zero represents off while one represents on.
    
    Binary is still used with electronics and computer hardware. Programmers can use binary to control the flow of electricity and the positive and negative poles of a magnet. Binary code allows programmers to create simple instructions and procedures for computers.
    

    <h1>
    Low-Level vs. High-Level
</h1>
    Computer programmers split coding languages into two groups: low-level and high-level.
    
    Low-level languages, like binary, are considered "machine-oriented." Machine-oriented languages write instructions that must be specified in terms of the capabilities of the processor in question. Coders also refer to low-level languages as assembly language or machine code.
    
    High-level languages are user-oriented. Most of the popular coding languages, such as Python, fall under this category. Programmers designed high-level languages to convert an algorithm into program code more easily. High-level coding languages are closer to human language â€” they include more nuance and adaptability than low-level coding languages.
